# Introduction

Welcome on the documentation of jolicode/slack-php-api.

This library is a **PHP client** for **Slack's Web API**.

## About this SDK

There is a bunch of existing PHP clients for Slack. But some are not up to date
or miss features, some only cover a small part of the API and most are simply
no longer maintained.

This SDK is generated automatically with [JanePHP](https://github.com/janephp/janephp)
from the [official Slack API specs](https://github.com/slackapi/slack-api-specs).

It also provides a **full object oriented interface** for all the endpoints,
requests and responses of the Slack Web API.
